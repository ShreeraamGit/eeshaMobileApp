### Component Props

This section provides a comprehensive reference list for the component props, detailing descriptions, properties, types, and default behavior for easy project integration.

#### HStack

HStack component is created using View component from react-native. It extends all the props supported by [React Native View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view#props) and the props mentioned below.

<>
  <Table>
    <TableHeader>
      <TableRow>
        <TableHeaderCell>Prop</TableHeaderCell>
        <TableHeaderCell>Type</TableHeaderCell>
        <TableHeaderCell>Default</TableHeaderCell>
        <TableHeaderCell>Description</TableHeaderCell>
      </TableRow>
    </TableHeader>
    <TableBody>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>
          <InlineCode>space</InlineCode>
        </TableCell>
        <TableCell>string</TableCell>
        <TableCell>-</TableCell>
        <TableCell>
          It sets the space between children. By default there is no space
          between the HStack items.
        </TableCell>
      </TableRow>
      <TableRow>
        <TableCell>
          <InlineCode>reversed</InlineCode>
        </TableCell>
        <TableCell>boolean</TableCell>
        <TableCell>false</TableCell>
        <TableCell>
          When true, it places the HStack items in reverse direction.
        </TableCell>
      </TableRow>
    </TableBody>
  </Table>
</>

### Accessibility

The accessibility of a HStack is primarily determined by the accessibility information of the components it contains. When you pass an accessible component inside a HStack, its accessibility attributes, such as labels and hints, will be utilized by assistive technologies like screen readers.

### Examples

The Examples section provides visual representations of the different variants of the component, allowing you to quickly and easily determine which one best fits your needs. Simply copy the code and integrate it into your project.
