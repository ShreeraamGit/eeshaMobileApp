# 📱 Mobile App Fix - Monorepo Entry Point Issue

**Issue:** Mobile app failed to start after monorepo restructuring
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## 🔍 Problem

After restructuring the project into a monorepo, the mobile app failed to start with error:

```
ConfigError: Cannot resolve entry file: The `main` field defined in your `package.json`
points to an unresolvable or non-existent path.
```

**Root Cause:**
When we moved the mobile app from root to `packages/mobile/`, the `package.json` was still pointing to `node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js` which doesn't exist in the monorepo structure.

---

## ✅ Solutions Applied

### 1. Created Entry Point File

**File:** `packages/mobile/index.js`

```javascript
import { registerRootComponent } from 'expo';
import App from './App';

registerRootComponent(App);
```

This is the standard Expo entry point that:
- Imports your main `App.tsx` component
- Registers it with React Native's AppRegistry
- Works in both Expo Go and native builds

### 2. Updated package.json Main Field

**Before:**
```json
{
  "main": "node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "main": "index.js"
}
```

### 3. Updated Expo Package Versions

Fixed compatibility warnings by updating to latest Expo SDK 54 versions:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "^54.0.12",                  // Was: ^54.0.10
    "expo-notifications": "~0.32.12",    // Was: ~0.32.11
    "expo-router": "~6.0.10",            // Was: ~6.0.8
    "react-native-worklets": "0.5.1"     // Was: ^0.6.0
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint-config-expo": "~10.0.0",     // Was: ^7.0.0
    "jest-expo": "~54.0.12"              // Was: ~50.0.1
  }
}
```

### 4. Reinstalled Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# Installed updated packages in monorepo
```

---

## 🎯 Verification

### Test Mobile App

```bash
npm run mobile
# Should start successfully without errors
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Starting Metro Bundler
Metro waiting on exp://192.168.1.xxx:8081
Scan the QR code...
```

### No More Warnings

Before fix:
```
The following packages should be updated for best compatibility:
  expo@54.0.10 - expected version: 54.0.12
  expo-notifications@0.32.11 - expected version: ~0.32.12
  ...
```

After fix:
```
✅ All packages compatible with Expo SDK 54
```

## 📚 Understanding the Monorepo Structure

### Entry Point Flow

```
Root package.json (npm run mobile)
    ↓
packages/mobile/package.json (expo start)
    ↓
packages/mobile/index.js (entry point)
    ↓
packages/mobile/App.tsx (your app)
```

### Why This Works

1. **Root command** (`npm run mobile`) calls the mobile workspace
2. **Expo CLI** reads `packages/mobile/package.json`
3. **`main` field** points to `index.js` in the same directory
4. **`index.js`** imports and registers `App.tsx`
5. **App starts** successfully

## 🏗️ Monorepo Best Practices

### Entry Points in Workspaces

Each workspace package should have its entry point relative to its own directory:

```
packages/
├── mobile/
│   ├── index.js          ← Entry point (main)
│   ├── App.tsx           ← Root component
│   └── package.json      ← "main": "index.js"
│
├── admin/
│   ├── src/app/page.tsx  ← Next.js entry
│   └── package.json      ← Next.js handles entry
│
└── shared/
    ├── src/index.ts      ← Package export
    └── package.json      ← "main": "src/index.ts"
```

### Package Scripts

Run from **root directory**:

```bash
# Mobile app
npm run mobile              # Uses workspace @eesha/mobile
npm run mobile:ios          # Runs on iOS
npm run mobile:android      # Runs on Android

# Admin dashboard
npm run admin               # Uses workspace @eesha/admin

# Both in parallel
npm run dev                 # Runs mobile + admin
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot find module './App'"

**Solution:**
Check that `App.tsx` exists in `packages/mobile/`:
```bash
ls packages/mobile/App.tsx
```

### Issue: "Metro bundler fails to start"

**Solution:**
Clear Metro cache:
```bash
cd packages/mobile
npx expo start --clear
```

### Issue: Package version mismatch

**Solution:**
Update all Expo packages together:
```bash
cd packages/mobile
npx expo install --fix
```

### Issue: "Cannot resolve @eesha/shared"

**Solution:**
Reinstall from root:
```bash
cd /path/to/eesha_app
npm install
```
